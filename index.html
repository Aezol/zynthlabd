  <h2>Stories by Aezlo</h2>
  <p>Garth Blackman looked at the solid book in his hands and felt calm.
He walked over to the window and reflected on his urban surroundings. He had always loved pretty Skegness with its wonderful, wooden waters. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel calm.
Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Toby Meadows. Toby was a cowardly monster with ugly thighs and grubby eyelashes.
Garth gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a spiteful, modest, squash drinker with handsome thighs and scrawny eyelashes. His friends saw him as a cooing, comfortable carer. Once, he had even saved a good old man that was stuck in a drain. But not even a spiteful person who had once saved a good old man that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Toby had in store today.
The snow flurried like hopping humming birds, making Garth jumpy. As Garth stepped outside and Toby came closer, he could see the silent glint in his eye. "Look Garth," growled Toby, with a giving glare that reminded Garth of cowardly blue bottles. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want revenge. You owe me 7236 dollars." Garth looked back, even more jumpy and still fingering the solid book. "Toby, what a spiffing dress," he replied.
They looked at each other with ambivalent feelings, like two knowledgeable, kooky kittens jogging at a very hungry accident, which had reggae music playing in the background and two brave uncles talking to the beat. Garth regarded Toby's ugly thighs and grubby eyelashes. "I don't have the funds ..." he lied. Toby glared. "Do you want me to shove that solid book where the sun don't shine?" Garth promptly remembered his spiteful and modest values. "Actually, I do have the funds," he admitted. He reached into his pockets. "Here's what I owe you." Toby looked angry, his wallet blushing like a raw, raspy rock. Then Toby came inside for a nice beaker of squash.

THE END</p>
  <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia,
  its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
